!Start circuit definition
!
! Rev. 1 50264 is based on the Z15 rev 4 deck with L higher
!
! Rev 4 is the same as Rev 2 EXCEPT I will adjust the length of the switch arc channel 
! that is the simple way of adjusting the channel conductivity.
!
! We start with a capacitor and switch with the parameters based on the
! Thor II brick with the 80 nF version of the GA 35426M Capacitor 40 nF,
! 15 nH, start with a 0.13 ½ ESR. We will use a total inductance of 200 nH for the brick
! that includes the inductance of the feeds leading to the load and the
! inductance of the load.
! 
! At this point we really do not know the time dependent ESR of the capacitor.
!
! We will use the Martin Switch model for the 50264 Switch
!
! The charge voltage will be 100 kV. This is the operating point for the SNL test brick.

! 90 psia air 
!
! Initial switch resistance was chosen to be higher than that printed in the first
! few time steps so as to appear monotonically decreasing in R plots
! A careful few runs sowed that 10 G½ looked best. In any event by 1 ns all of the 
! resistance values are the same.
