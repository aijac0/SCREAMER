!    We begin with a model of 1 LTD cavity
!    We assume each LTD cavity has a capacitance of 280 nF X 20 bricks = 5.6 µF.
!
RCG  1.0E12    5.6e-6
!
!    We assume each cavity is charged to 100 kV.

!    We assume each cavity has a resistance of (0.03 Ohm + 0.02 ohms)/20 = 0.0025 Ohms
!    We assume each cavity has an inductance of (20 nH + 15 nH + 15 nh)/20 = 2.5 nH.

RLS  0.0025  2.5E-9
!
! We want the stack to flash on reversal - use a time constraint
! 
RCG 1e6 0
! Use var resistor
!    We assume each cavity has a core loss that can be modeled as a shunt resistance of
!    4 ohms.
